# PROJECT printf
# REPO: printf

This is a clone of the Printf function found in the Standard Input/Output Library (stdio.h) and is responsible for printing data to the standard output (typically the console) in a specified format. Itâ€™s an essential tool for displaying information to users and debugging programs.
This Printf clone works like the regular printf and is able to handle format specifiers just like it does.
